   	<h4>About Me</h4>
   	<p>My Name is Roy Frias, I graduated with a teaching Degree from Montclair State University. I've had quite the journey to finally get here to General Assembly. I've had many different jobs, from sales, to working at Homedepot to being a Bailbonds Agent. Now I work in the Finance world and im seeing that technology is the movement right now. I always had a love for coding ever since I started college years ago. My first go at coding was way back in my Junior year of high school in where they offered a very basic coding class. There they thought me the basics of C++ and Visual Basics two ancient programming languages.</p>

   	<p> I've loved coding ever since many things have happened through out my life that derailed me from coding but finally i've decided to partake in what I love and make it My career. At the moment I am working full time as an Associate Banker at JpMorgan Chase. But once I am done with this course I will be moving on to doing the Javascript course because I am going to become a full Front End Developer. I recently had a son, a baby boy name Shiloh who practically has stolen my heart and time. But this course I am dedicating every ounce for him so I can have an amazing career for my self to be able to provide for him and my loving wife.
